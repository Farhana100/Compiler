# Compiler

This is a simple compiler for the language described in the book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. It is not a complete compiler, but it does implement a lexer, a parser, and a code generator.

## Usage
1. create a file input.txt with the code you want to compile
2. execute `./script.sh`
